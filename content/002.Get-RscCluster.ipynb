    "RSC has the ability to work databases in any of the datacenters connected to RSC. This is done by having a Rubrik Vault or cluster in each data center. To be able to interact with those objects you first have to get the cluster information, specifically the ID of the cluster. This is especially true if you are using replicaiton with Rubrik as the object you are searching for could exist in multiple Rubrik clusters. Once as the replicated source and as the replicated target. \n",
